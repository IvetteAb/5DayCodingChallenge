                Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!
				</li>
				<li>
					Pop a tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)
				</li>
				<li>
					Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.
				</li>
				<li>
					Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.
				</li>
				<li>
					Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enjoy!
