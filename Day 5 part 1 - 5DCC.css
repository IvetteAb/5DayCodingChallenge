Day 5

 - 1st challenge: Breathing space, expansion and contraction
 
 
You will:
- Add an outer container that wraps around all the content of the page
- Target that container with a style that sets the container width and also centers the container
- Target that container with a media query that contains styles that are triggered once the screen size goes below a certain value

Steps:

1) On line 13 a <div> element that acts as the parent for all content has been created for you. Add an id attribute to that <div> element with the value of container
2) Create a style rule with an id selector that targets the container id
3) Inside the #container rule set the width to 60%
4) Inside the #container rule set the margin to auto
5) Create a media query that will apply styles for screen size up to a max-width of 768px
6) Reuse the #container style rule inside the media query and set the width to 90%
7) Reuse the h1 style rule inside the  media query and set the font-size to 200%

						Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.

						Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.

					<li>
						If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
